### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Patryk, a passionate programmer primarily focused on ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
 development. My goal is to become a Python developer or web developer, with a stronger inclination towards backend development and some frontend skills. I'm continuously expanding my knowledge in ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white), ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white), ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E), ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white), ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB), and ![Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/django-%23092E20.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=django&logoColor=white) frameworks. 


I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with industry trends. I'm enthusiastic about solving problems, writing clean and efficient code, and working in a collaborative environment.
